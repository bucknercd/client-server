This is a simple client / server program I made for my systems class 3423 , UTSA , Maynard. 

It uses named pipes.

I have makefiles so you can just use those to compile programs.
you will need to compile server.c and client.c


just run the server executable
execute the client program as so.  $ client <command>    // ie   client ls  or  $ client cat

before running these programs the fifos will need to be created. I used /tmp/disp and /tmp/rfifo

use mkfifo command to make these fifos or program will not work.  ( you will get an exec error)
